//leetcode-455 :https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies

//Problem Statement: Given two arrays representing childrenâ€™s green factor and cookie sizes,
//the goal is to maximise the number of content children.

//Each child i has a greed factor of g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that will make the child content.
//Each cookie j has a size of s[j]. If s[j] >= g[j], we can assign cookie j to child i, making the child content. Each child can only receive one cookie.

public class AssignCookies {

    // number of content children

        // the cookieSize array
        int m = cookieSize.length;

        // order to try and satisfy the
        // least greedy children first
        Arrays.sort(greed);

        // Sort the cookie sizes in ascending
        // order to use the smallest cookies first
        Arrays.sort(cookieSize);

        // greed array, starting from
        // the first child

        // cookies and children
