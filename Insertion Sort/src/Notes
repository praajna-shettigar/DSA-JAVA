For every index:
put that index element at the correct index of left hand side

After first pass(i=0):first 2 element will be sorted(sorted till index no 1)
After 2nd pass(i=1) : first 3 element will be sorted(sorted till index no 2)
same repeat

complexity
----------
worst case : O(N*N) when array is sorted in desc order
best case :O(N) when array is in sorted order

use of Selection sort
---------------------
*adaptive: Steps get reduced if array is sorted. No of steps reduced as compared to bubble sort
*stable :
* used for smaller values of N => works good when arrray is partially sorted
