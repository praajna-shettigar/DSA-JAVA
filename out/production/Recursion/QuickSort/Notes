Quick sort
------------
Quick sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm and is based on partitioning of array of data into smaller arrays.
A large array is partitioned into two arrays one of which holds values smaller than the specified value, say pivot,
based on which the partition is made and another array holds values greater than the pivot value.

What is Quick Sort?
-------------------
* Quick sort, also known as partition-exchange sort, is an in-place sorting algorithm.
  It is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works on the idea of selecting a pivot element and dividing the array into two subarrays around that pivot.

* In quick sort, after selecting the pivot element, the array is split into two subarrays.
  One subarray contains elements smaller than the pivot element, and the other subarray contains elements greater than the pivot element.


Recurence relation of Quick Sort
--------------------------------
T(N) = T(K) + T(N-K-1) + O(N)

Time Complexity
-----------------
Worst case : when greatest element is taken as pivot element
----------
            T(N) = T(N-1) + O(N)
            O(N2)

Best Case
---------
T(N) = 2T(N/2) + O(N)

O(NlogN)
