Bubble sort
-----------
--this algorithm is known as inplace sorting algorithm
-In evey step we are comparing adjecent element
-After  first iteration largest element will come to end
-After 2nd iteration last 2 element will be at the correct place---same repeat
--this is also known as sinking sort or exchange sort
--space complexity = O(1) //constant //no extra space is required
-time complexity
  -Best case : O(N) => when array is sorted
  -Worst case : O(N2)-N square => when array is sorted in reverse form

-When j never swap for the value that means array is sorted
