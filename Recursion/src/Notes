Recursion : Recursion is function calling itself
Base Condition : It is a simple "if" condition where our recursion will stop making new calls
* when there is no base condition, function call will keep happening, stack will be filled.
  memory of the computer will exceed the limit -> shows stackoverflow error
*If you are calling same function again and again, you can treat it as separate call in stack

Why Recursion
-------------
* It helps us in solving bigger/complex problems in a simple way
*You can convert recursion solution into iteration & vice versa
* Space Complexity is not constant because of recursive calls
*It help us in breaking down bigger problems into smaller problems

How to understand and approach a problem
----------------------------------------
1.Identify if you can break the problem into smaller problem
2.Write the recurrence relation if needed
3.Draw the recurrence tree
4.About the tree
  * see the flow of function,how they are getting in stack
  * Identify and focus on left tree calls and right tree calls
  * Draw the tree and pointers again and again using pen and paper, use debugger to see the flow.
5. See how the values are returned in each step.see where function call comes out of

Types of recurrence relation
----------------------------
1.Linear recurrence relation -> Fibo
2.Divide and  conquer recurrence relation -> Binary search --> F(N) = O(1) + F(N/2)
