The Adapter Design Pattern is a structural design pattern used to bridge the gap between two incompatible interfaces,
allowing them to work together. It acts as a translator between a client and an incompatible service or class.

Key Concepts of Adapter Pattern:
Client: The object that requires a specific interface to interact with a service.
Adaptee: The existing class or service with an interface incompatible with the client.
Adapter: A wrapper that translates the Adaptee's interface into one that the client understands.
