The Facade Design Pattern is a structural design pattern
that provides a simplified interface to a larger body of code,
making it easier to interact with complex subsystems. It hides the complexities of the
subsystem by exposing only high-level operations.

When to Use Facade Pattern
To simplify client interactions with a complex subsystem.
To provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
When working with a legacy codebase, where restructuring is not feasible.
To decouple the client code from the subsystem.
