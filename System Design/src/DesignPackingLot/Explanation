Problem Statement:
Design a parking lot system that manages parking for different types of vehicles (e.g., motorcycles, cars, and buses).
The system should handle parking, retrieving parked vehicles, and tracking available spaces.

Requirements:
1.Parking Levels: The parking lot can have multiple levels (or floors).
2.Parking Spots: There are different types of parking spots based on the size of vehicles:
  *.Motorcycle spots: Smallest spots that only motorcycles can park in.
  *.Car spots: Spots that can accommodate motorcycles and cars.
  *.Bus spots: Largest spots that can accommodate buses, cars, and motorcycles.
3.Vehicles: Different types of vehicles require different spot sizes:
  *.Motorcycle
  *.Car
  *.Bus: Takes multiple parking spots.
4.Track Availability: The system should track and report available parking spots by type.
5.Parking and Unparking: The system should allow vehicles to park in available spots and free up spaces when vehicles leave.


Classes and Relationships:
We'll use object-oriented principles to design this system, identifying core entities, their properties, and behaviors.

1. ParkingLot
This class represents the entire parking lot. It manages multiple levels and delegates the responsibility of managing parking spots to those levels.

2. ParkingLevel
Each level has a fixed number of parking spots for different vehicle types. It manages parking spots and tracks availability on that level.

3. ParkingSpot
This represents a single parking spot on a level. Each parking spot has a size (Motorcycle, Car, or Bus) and can either be empty or occupied by a vehicle.

4. Vehicle
This is a base class for different vehicle types like Motorcycle, Car, and Bus. Each vehicle requires a specific type of spot (small, medium, or large)
